# NEW Release! Version-Agnostic.
This is a real Laravel-Module, not file modifications like before.
Compatible with multiple versions of 6amMart. Tested with 6amMart v3.x.
Please report compatibility with v2.9 and older!
# Versioning number
Since this is a new Module, Version will start from v1.
New version number does not reflect on the 6amMart version.
If you update 6amMart, you need to re-upload just 1 file: /resources/views/admin-views/addon-activation/index.blade.php
This page is the Awg Cloud Module settings.
Alternate Awg Cloud Module settings page is https://6ammart-domain.com/admin/awgcloud

If you don't, you will send double notifications.
